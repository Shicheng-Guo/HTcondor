# HTcondor in UW-Madison

The HTCondor software was known as 'Condor' from 1988 until its name changed in 2012. HTCondor is the product of years of research by the Center for High Throughput Computing in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and it was first installed as a production system in the UW-Madison Department of Computer Sciences over 15 years ago. This HTCondor installation has since served as a major source of computing cycles to UW-Madison faculty and students. Additional HTCondor installations have been established over the years across our campus and the world. Hundreds of organizations in industry, government, and academia have used HTCondor to establish compute installations ranging in size from a handful to many thousands of workstations.
